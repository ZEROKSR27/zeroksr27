### 👤 Who I Am

- 🎯 **Offer**: Not satisfied with the result? It was free.  
- 🚀 **Goal**: Build real products that generate value (and income).  
- 🧠 **Learning Style**: Independent, product-based. No bootcamps, no tutorial traps.  
- 🧱 **Tech Foundation**: Solid with `React Native`, `TypeScript`, `TailwindCSS`, `GSAP` / `Framer Motion`, `Next.js`, `Git` / `Docker`, `Figma`.  
- 📚 **Now**: Diving into backend and testing tools — while managing full-time school under Iraq's intense SADIS year.
